## ü¶æ Description

**PoshPiHole** is a PowerShell module that enables you to interact with your Pi-hole server programmatically.
It provides functions to:

* Manage DNS blocking
* Retrieve real-time and historical statistics
* Query domain history
* Access database summaries
* And more!

---

## üõ† Requirements

* PowerShell 7 or higher
* Pi-hole v6+
* HTTP access to your Pi-hole server

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è HTTPS is **not supported**

---

## üì¶ Installation

Install from the PowerShell Gallery:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PoshPiHole -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

## üîê Authentication

All cmdlets require a `PSCredential` object.
The **username can be anything**, but the password must match your Pi-hole password.

```powershell
$creds = Get-Credential -UserName admin
```
